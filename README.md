Capstone Project â€“ IBM SkillsBuild x HackAnalysis of Mental Health Impact on Student Academic Performance

#Project Overview
Mental health is a crucial factor influencing students' lives, including their academic achievements. In this project, I analyze survey data on students' psychological conditions to understand the relationship between depression and academic performance (CGPA), as well as identify the most influential factors affecting their mental well-being.

The objectives of this project are:
1. To analyze the relationship between depression levels and student academic performance.
2. To identify factors triggering depression, such as financial stress, sleep duration, and academic pressure.
3. To provide data-driven recommendations to support student mental health.

#Dataset
1. File Name: student_depression_dataset.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/code/adilshamim8/student-depression)
2. Data Source: This dataset is a survey result containing information about students' psychological conditions, sleep habits, academic pressure, financial stress, and GPA.(from kaggle) 
3. Number of Columns: 18
4. Sample Size: The data includes various variables such as Gender, Age, Depression, Sleep Duration, Financial Stress, CGPA, etc.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Several EDA steps have been performed:
2. Visualization of depression level distribution.
3. Analysis of the relationship between depression and GPA.
4. Correlation among numerical variables.
5. Visualization of the impact of sleep duration and financial stress on depression.

#Insights & Findings
1. High levels of depression among students, indicating the importance of attention to mental health.
2. Depression does not directly lower GPA, but it risks affecting long-term performance.
3. Extreme sleep patterns (very little or very long) correlate with depression levels.
4. Financial stress has a strong relationship with depression, highlighting economic pressure as a significant factor.
5. The highest correlations with depression were found for the following variables:
  Financial Stress (positive)
  Suicidal Thoughts (positive)
  Family History of Mental Illness (positive)

#AI Support Explanation
  In this project, I utilized two types of AI to support the analysis process:
1. ChatGPT (OpenAI)
Assisted in explaining general data concepts.
Helped structure the analysis and summarize exploration results.
Generated automated text such as insights, recommendations, and README content efficiently.
2. IBM Granite Model via AI Agent
Used to:
  Simplify findings from graphs.
  Analyze potential cause-and-effect relationships from data patterns.
  Provide additional validation for insights obtained from manual exploration.
  With the help of AI, I could analyze data faster, formulate insights automatically, and generate targeted recommendations.

#Conclusion & Recommendation
Conclusion:
  Student depression levels are quite high and closely related to financial pressure, family history, and sleep quality. Although not directly lowering GPA, mental health has the potential to significantly affect academic performance.

#Recommendations:
Campuses need to provide easier and more proactive access to counseling services.
Financial literacy education and scholarship assistance can reduce economic stress.
Campaigns emphasizing sleep and stress management are highly recommended.

#Tools & Technology
